# C++ Lab G - SIMD Instructions and DirectXMath

## Exercise 1 - Benchmarks

### Q: Produce a set of reliable, reproducible and effective benchmarks.

## Exercise 2 - DirectXMath/GLM

### Q: Use DirectXMath or GLM to replicate the benchmarks created in Q1. How do the results compare to the original implementation?

## Exercise 3 - SIMD

### Q: Select one of the three methods discussed in the lecture to change the data members and functionality of the vector and matrix classes. How do the results compare to the original implementation?

## Exercise 4 - Raytracer

### Q: Profile the raytracer using both a sampling and an instrumented profiler.
